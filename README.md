# Crime-Prediction-Analysis
# Crime Prediction Analysis

## Overview
A machine learning project that analyzes historical crime data to predict crime patterns and identify high-risk areas. This system helps in understanding crime trends and supports better resource allocation for public safety.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Data Analysis (pandas, numpy)
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Multiple ML model implementation
- Crime pattern visualization
- Prediction and evaluation

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crime-prediction-analysis.git
cd crime-prediction-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to train models and generate predictions.
